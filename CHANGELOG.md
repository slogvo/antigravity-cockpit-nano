## [1.6.0]

### Added
- **Auto Wake-up**: New feature to schedule automated requests to AI models
  - Set up timed wake-up calls to trigger quota reset cycles in advance
  - Supports daily, weekly, interval-based, and advanced Crontab scheduling
  - Multi-model selection: choose which models to trigger
  - Trigger history with request/response details (persisted for 7 days, up to 40 records)

## [1.5.48]

### Fixed
- **i18n**: Fixed hardcoded text not using translation files

## [1.5.47]

### Fixed
- **List View Consistency**: Updated list view to use the same "Manage Groups" logic as the card view, ensuring consistent group management across all views.

## [1.5.46]

### Added
- **Custom Grouping**: New "Manage Groups" modal for manual group management
  - Create, rename, and delete custom groups
  - Add/remove models to groups with multi-select support
  - Compatible models sorted first; incompatible models dynamically disabled
  - "Auto Group" button to pre-fill groups based on quota (preserves existing group names via majority vote)
  - Quota validation: only models with same quota and reset time can be grouped
  - Models auto-removed from group when quota changes cause inconsistency (minority models removed, majority retained)

### Improved
- **Toast Notifications**: Now displayed above all modals (z-index: 9999)
- **Privacy**: Telemetry and error reporting are now **disabled by default**. Users can manually enable them in settings (`agCockpit.telemetryEnabled`) if they wish to help improve the extension.

## [1.5.45]

### Refactor
- **Error Handling**: Introduced `AntigravityError` class to uniformly manage and filter expected errors (timeouts, server messages, startup checks) from Sentry reporting

## [1.5.44]

### Fixed
- **Startup Protection**: Prevent API requests before system is fully engaged (port 0), avoiding erroneous "Connection Refused (443)" errors

## [1.5.43]

### Fixed
- **Proxy Bypass**: Forced bypass of HTTP proxy for localhost connections to resolve timeouts when users have global proxy settings enabled

## [1.5.42]

### Improved
- **Error Reporting**: Server-side errors (e.g., "not logged in") are no longer reported to Sentry

## [1.5.41]

### Improved
- **Network Timeout**: Increased HTTP request timeout from 5s to 10s for better compatibility with WSL2 and slow network environments

## [1.5.40]

### Improved
- **Auto Group Split**: Groups are now automatically split when model quotas become inconsistent during refresh

## [1.5.39]

### Improved
- **Error Reporting**: Only report errors that occur during initial startup; subsequent sync failures after successful data fetch are silently ignored
- **Server Error Display**: Backend error messages are now transparently shown to users with "Antigravity Error:" prefix instead of generic "Invalid server response"

## [1.5.38]

### Improved
- **Error Reporting**: Added anonymous user/session identifiers and editor metadata to better separate user environments
- **Diagnostics Context**: Included runtime limits and extension configuration snapshots in error events
- **Tagging**: Added editor, URI scheme, and UI kind tags for quick filtering

  - Automatically captures and reports errors for faster bug fixes
  - Respects VS Code's global telemetry settings
  - Can be disabled via `agCockpit.telemetryEnabled` setting
  - Collects: error stack trace, OS type & version, VS Code version, extension version

## [1.5.36]

### Improved
- **Windows Process Detection**: Refactored detection logic to exclusively use PowerShell with robust UTF-8 encoding enforcement. This resolves garbled error messages on non-English systems and eliminates reliance on the deprecated `wmic` tool.
- **Connection Stability**: Increased PowerShell connection timeout from 8s to 15s to better accommodate environments with long cold start times.

## [1.5.35]

- Fix: Resolved 'Unexpected end of JSON input' startup error with auto-recovery logic
- Improved: Enhanced diagnostic logging for API response errors

## [1.5.34]

### Improved
- **Remaining Time Display**: Adaptive time format for better readability
  - Less than 60 minutes: `Xm` (e.g., `45m`)
  - Less than 24 hours: `Xh Ym` (e.g., `4h 57m`)
  - 24 hours or more: `Xd Yh Zm` (e.g., `1d 2h 30m`)

## [1.5.33]

### Fixed
- **Data Masking**: Added missing `agCockpit.dataMasked` configuration declaration in `package.json`, fixing the issue where "Hide Data" button had no effect.

## [1.5.32]

### Fixed
- **Translation Key**: Fixed incorrect translation key `status.error` → `statusBar.error` in status bar controller.
- **Data Masking Persistence**: "Hide Data" state in Plan Details now persists across Dashboard reopens and restarts.
- **Variable Declaration Order**: Moved `isProfileHidden` and `isDataMasked` declarations to top of dashboard.js for better code organization.

### Improved
- **UX**: Changed reset countdown text from "Restored" to "Restoring Soon" for more accurate representation (quota restore has latency).
- **i18n**: Updated `dashboard.online` translations in all 14 languages.

## [1.5.31]

### Fixed
- **Memory Leak**: Fixed event listener leak in Logger service - now properly disposes configuration change listener.

### Improved
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed unused variables and imports across multiple files.

## [1.5.30]

### Added
- **Unit Testing**: Integrated Jest framework and added tests for process detection logic.

### Improved
- **Build**: Reduced VSIX package size from 216 KB to 162 KB.
- **Clean up**: Removed legacy files from build output.

## [1.5.23]

### Improved
- **Detection**: Refined Antigravity process detection by requiring server port + CSRF token and removing path-based matching to avoid false positives.
- **Optimization**: Reduced VSIX package size by ~67% via `.vscodeignore` (excluded `src`, source maps, and demo assets).
- **Engineering**: Resolved all lint issues and updated TS config to support modern ESM imports.

### Fixed
- **Status Bar**: Corrected status bar tooltip to display user tier name instead of internal ID.

## [1.5.22]

### Fixed
- **Dashboard Update**: Fixed an issue where the dashboard panel would not update with fresh data if it was in the background during an auto-refresh.
- **Quota Precision**: Fixed a discrepancy in quota percentage display between the dashboard (List View) and Status Bar. Both now consistently round down (floor) to the nearest integer.

## [1.5.21]

---
